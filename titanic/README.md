## *Did Jack Dawson REALLY have to die in Titanic?*
<br>

### **<big>[ Background ]</big>**

The tragic death of Jack Dawson, a fictional character from the 1997 film Titanic, has not only brought tears to many viewers' eyes, but also speculation about whether or not his heroic sacrifice was indeed necessary.<br>

While many argued that Jack could have survived based on the size of  the raft, a senior writer at Screen Rant, Q.V. Hough took a literatural approach and concluded in his [article](https://screenrant.com/titanic-movie-jack-rose-die-save-door-reason/) released in 2020 that Jack Dawson's death was inevitable 'for the sake of narrative harmony'.

This project, inspired by Hugh's rather unusual yet completely valid approach, will analyse the data from the actual Titanic survivor data.
